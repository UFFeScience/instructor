# INSTRUCTOR 

# About this tool
The INSTRUCTOR is an academic development tool to provide an environment for the application of clustering algorithms to detect anomalous behaviors in the marine traffic.

Through a visual interface the user can plot an Area of Interest (AOI) and save it for further loading. After that, it is possible to generate a grid of cells to map this AOI in order to analyze vessels trajectories with clustering algorithms using recorded data from Automatic Information System (AIS) transmissions.
